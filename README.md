Vibration Interface
==================

A vibration interface for the Arduino, with example applications.

1. `LasercutPartsCADFiles` includes all files for building the interface, with files for cutting using Ponoko.
2. `LevelGenerationTimeTest` is a small app for testing how quickly the Arduino can generate a 2d array and randomly walk through it - used to optimize the included Mesa game.
3. `Mesa` is an example application for the interface where a player navigates an algorithmically-generated mesa, avoiding the cliff's edge.
4. `ProcessPhotos` includes documentation of the development process for this project.
5. `Simon` is a similar to the classic game of the same name, where the player must match an ever-lengthening pattern of directions. Instead of colored lights and sounds, this game uses the four vibration directions.
